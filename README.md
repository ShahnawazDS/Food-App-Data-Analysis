# Food-App-Data-Analysis

Food apps have become increasingly popular over the years, allowing users to order food online, discover new restaurants, and track their food intake. Data analysis can help food app companies understand user behavior and preferences, improve their services, and make data-driven decisions.

To perform data analysis on food app data, several tools can be used, including Python, Excel, and MySQL. Python can be used for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Excel can be used for data management, filtering, and basic analysis. MySQL can be used for database management and querying.

Some common data analysis tasks for food app data include:

User behavior analysis: This involves analyzing user data to understand user behavior and preferences, such as popular dishes, frequent orders, and preferred restaurants. This can be done using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Restaurant analysis: This involves analyzing restaurant data to understand restaurant performance, such as order volume, customer ratings, and menu popularity. This can be done using MySQL queries and Excel pivot tables.
